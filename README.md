# My Book

## Objective
Create a personal online profile, similar to Facebook or any social media platform you prefer, using HTML and CSS. Below are some guidelines to help you come up with some ideas. Feel free to stray from the goals as much as you want. This is a great chance to be creative so go wild! If you don't want to create a profile for yourself, create one for your favorite fictional character.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

\* Note: Bootstrap is included if you would like to use it. However, it is possible to complete this assignment using pure CSS.
